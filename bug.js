This bug occurs when using the Expo ImagePicker library with certain image formats, particularly those with metadata that the library doesn't properly handle.  The error usually manifests as a failure to load the image or a crash with an exception related to image decoding.  The issue might be inconsistent, working with some images but failing with others depending on the embedded metadata.  It can also occur during the processing pipeline after selection, resulting in an unexpected empty value or error state instead of the image data.
